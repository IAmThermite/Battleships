#### HOW TO PLAY ####
1. Host a game
    If you want to make a new game you need to know your LAN IP address
    To find this open up the console and type 'ipconfig'
    Choose a port number (1024-65535)
    Give the port number and IP address (hostname) to your friend
    Click 'Host'

2. Join a game
    If your friend has made a game then you need to get the hostname and port
    Click 'Join'

3. Play the game    
    You should then see a grid.
    Click on a square and then the ship button to place
    Click 'Change Direction' to swap the orientation
    Once you have placed all ships click 'Done'
    
    You should now see a new screen with two fields similar to the last
    When it is your turn you will be notified in the log on the top right
    Click on a loctation on the bottom screen and click 'FIRE!'
    If you hit your opponents ship you get another go
    If you miss it will be your opponents turn
    
    First person to destroy all ships wins!
